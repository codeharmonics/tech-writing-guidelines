# Algolia Docs Style Guide

## Why create a style guide?

The goal of our docs is to help our customers create a great search experience using Algolia's technology. We aim to get them off to a **quick start**, and then walk them through every step towards their **first implementation**. We also want to encourage them to continuously enhance their solution by **adopting features** that ensure they get the most value out of Algolia's search technology.

To achieve these goals, we need to pay close attention to the **quality of the content** as well as its **form**. *What* we say is as important as *how* we say it.

By form we mean page structure, paragraph and sentence length, word choice, use of punctuation, and a other such writing choices. We also mean voice and tone.

## Great documentation is like an index

The structure and language of an index is as important to search as the content it contains. When the words that describe products and services do not match the expectations and terms used during a search, the searched-for information is lost. On the other hand, when data is organized into smart, digestible chunks of information, and written in a familiar language, the content is more clearly accessible. Obscure language makes products obscure.

This is the same for documentation. Technical content needs to be well-organized; it needs a structure that gives meaning to the large quantities of content. Unstructured content is not accessible without a story or a frame that puts everything into its proper context. Additionally, the language we use to describe features and technical processes must be consistent and familiar so that readers can find and make sense of what they are looking for. **Readers need to be able to read, skip around, and scan through our language.** If our style does not make content jump off the page and instantly appeal to a reader, it will fail to teach.

Therefore, paying close attention to *how* we write as well as *what* we write goes a long way in helping our users build a great search experience. **Poor form will cause readers to give up or build a first and only implementation using the bare minimum of our potential. Poor form undermines our company's reputation and market potential.**

## Our guidelines - Rules or Suggestions?

What we've done here, after a few years of iterating on form and content, is to document the stylistic and formal decisions of our docs. We set out these guidelines to ensure that all current and future contributors understand what we expect from them.

Essentially, we want to make it easy for contributors to write great content.

Note that some of these guidelines are **prescriptive: they can be considered rules**. But not all. Some are **suggestions** that we encourage you to follow. However, we understand that different technical subjects and personal writing styles require more nuance than a static set of rules. We leave that level of engagement up to you.

Perhaps the most important suggestion, therefore, is to make a **best effort to follow these guidelines**. We have a review process for just this purpose, to ensure that our content reaches the highest standard.

So - create your content, make best efforts on the style, and then submit it to the doc team: we'll work together to improve, if needed, the final published version.
