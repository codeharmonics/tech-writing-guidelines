## The *Progressive Approach*

**Most pages should start out simple, easy to digest, understand. They should move gradually towards the complex. This is what we mean by *progressive***.

How to make a page progressive:

- Always start high-level, jargon-free. *All* readers should be able to understand the top of every page.
- Make your text immediately relevant. Jump directly into the subject. First sentence should grab every reader, either because it's meaningful to them or you've written it in a way that piques their curiosity.
- After the introductory paragraphs, move towards more technical content - but don't switch too quickly from easy to hard. **Introduce difficulty gradually** - define terms, use examples, give an overview of a technical solution before getting into the details.

**The last 2/3rd of the page can get as technical as needed.** We try to place all technical details (especially code) into our how-to and in-depth pages.

Following the above progressive approach, every reader with a minimum amount of technical expertise (see [below](https://github.com/algolia/doc/blob/style-docs/doc_team/style-docslines-page.md#scanability-and-the-technical-expertise-of-our-readers)) should find the top 1/3 of every page fairly easy to understand. And every impatient developer or reader should like the bottom 2/3 of every page.

## Scannable content

**Users should be able to read, skip around, or scan our content.**

All of our content should be *scannable*. This can have 3 meanings:
- Users should be able *scroll* to find what they need. They should be able to find - *easily and quickly* - the exact information they are looking for. 
- They should also know when and where they can *stop and read* to meet their needs. 
- They can also choose to *skip around* - read a little, scan a bit, jump to a hyperlink, then continue to read. 

Of course, they are also free to start at the top of a page and read every word until they reach the last. Up to them.

## Who are our readers?

We're writing *technical* content; therefore, all content should reach a minimum standard of technical usefulness. To ensure this, we've created a base reader: **our *least* technical reader is a first year computer science student**. This means that we can assume every reader has a basic set of computer science notions to understand Algolia's API.

The general philosophy is that we handhold a first-year student without boring the expert. We should make it easy for both extremes to find what they need: the novice needs to read, so we engage and simplify a bit; the expert needs to scan to find what they need, so "scannable content" is important. We believe the progressive approach is the best way to achieve this.

### Personas, in general

Besides the base reader, **we have a variety of personas, with each one searching for a different experience. We should always try to imagine *who* we are writing for.**

- Advanced Algolia users (Think SE)
- Expert developers or fast learners
- Methodical or slow learning ones
- Curious people
- Disoriented, confused readers, who, for whatever reason - distracted, bad night, or just high fear-factor in learning something new. The ones who push a door that says pull and keep pushing, who wave to the people inside to help open the door because it never occurs to them to pull. The ones who look for a bottle opener on a twist-off cap.

### Precise personas  
- Our least technical reader is a first-year Computer Science student.
- Our most technical reader can be a senior-level applications developer, a PHD computer science student, a low-level systems developer or architect, or an SE.
- Our readers can be curious or focused or lazy. Write to the curious, but give the focused and lazy clear indications where to find answers, code, how-to, and ref.
- Some readers learn by doing while others need to understand everything before starting; some readers are disoriented while others are at the top of their game. Try not to play favorites, give each one a place in your text.

### Reader purposes:
- They want to understand Algolia (all users)
- First time implementor (developers, tech leaders, project managers leading the technical project)
- Improving an existing solution
- Troubleshooting a problem
- Adding new features
