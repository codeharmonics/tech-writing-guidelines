## Voice - Make It Conversational

Engage your readers. Think of who they are and imagine that you are speaking directly to them, face to face. Make it conversational.

Try to put yourself in the shoes of our users. Understand their needs, ask yourself what would help them build a better application. One way to do this is to put your own spoken voice in your writing. After all, we're developers and fellow technical people, we've all read documentation, tried new APIs. Speak from your experience. Make it a conversation between you and your reader.

## Tone - Friendly but Authoritative

- Try to keep the tone casual and approachable, without being too informal.

- Make it friendly, empathetic.

- Try to write in the Active mode, not Passive. This is treated in the language page.

- Use the second person, as in "Your data .." or "You should do X ..". Imply the second person, as in "do this, do that". Using the second person engages a user; it makes them feel you are writing *to* them - which is actually the case because we always try to [write with a reader in mind](https://github.com/algolia/doc/blob/style-docs/doc_team/3-style-guide-first-principles.md#who-are-our-readers).

- The second person (you, your) also helps avoid the [passive tone](TODO).

- That said, the second person can be overused. Sometimes formality creates authority [TODO - I need some examples here. For example, write "It ...", as in "It sounds more official ... to say". Use "the" (as in "the data") when the noun (data) needs to stand out. Use "we", as in "we can expect"), or the impersonal (as in "a query is sent").] But these are exceptions; the rule is to personalize the text with the second person.

- Tend towards succinct. When in doubt, cut content as opposed to adding. though it takles longer to write less, it's worth the extra time. Write a lot, leave it for a day, remove the next day.

- Make use of code snippets and examples, but keep them to the point.

- Avoid marketing or sounding too "pitchy". The primary purpose of the docs isn't to sell Algolia. Replace superlatives with concrete facts: if something is "great", be more specific: is it "effective", "fast", "comprehensive", ...? This is treated in the Language page.

- Incorporate our values - trust, grit, candid, candor, care - into your writing: take a look at the [Algolia Voice Guide](https://algolia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/434044929/Algolia+Voice+Guide) to see how to do this.

## Active/Passive
- Be active. Create a feeling of action.
- Freely use "we" and "you".
- Start with a person (we or you) or a thing that performs an action ("the engine processes your request", "Algolia receives your data and processes it").
- Avoid starting with "it" or "there is/are". These terms are impersonal and passive and lead to passive and wordiness.
- But don't avoid starting with a central object; for example, "the response contains 10 items" instead of "you will receive a response with 10 items". Focus is put on response instead of process.
- "It" can effectively be used to convey the consequences of an action - it happens after you or we have performed an action. But this construct can often be avoided.
- The general idea is that nothing just happens: we and you make things happen, the engine performs. Active identifies the actor.

## Future / Present

- Imperative

## Consistent Terminology
- Consistent word choice on jargon, features, and important concepts.
- Consistent use of headers, especially on the page.
- Consistent use of examples. For every theory or statement, back it up with an example.
- Consistent use of hyperlinks
- Consistent use of acronyms

## Adding Marketing Content to Technical Documentation

This section is useful for two reasons:
- To *avoid* putting marketing content into the docs.
- To see how we can valorize not sell our services.

### Good technical writing sells itself
- Write to convey or clarify information, otherwise don't write it.
- Our quality or "goodness" should speak for itself.
- A feature is discussed as naturally flowing from detecting a problem and solving it, not because we are great for having it.
- Use straightforward, plain English, with a friendly voice and style, no fluff.
- Valorizing Algolia comes from word choice, voice and style, confidence, clarity - in other words, good writing sells Algolia.

### Feature / Benefit / Value (concrete) / Value (Customer Dreams) 

A feature is *what* something is, and a benefit is what users can *do* or *accomplish* with it, and value is how doing this adds "value" to the company. Value can also go further and make a customer dream: Algolia can give them a great reputation, make them a leader in the industry. 

Here's a good example:

- Feature: "Wetness indicator."
- Benefit: "Know when your babyâ€™s diaper needs changing."
- Value: "Have confidence your baby is comfortable and protected"
- Dream value: Be a Great Parent

Some points:

- Our documentation should always combine feature with benefit.
- We don't need to focus that much on value, but don't shy away from it either.
- However, the dream value should probably never be in our docs.

### Feature/Benefit

Feature + benefit is a useful way to introduce something, it makes the feature more memorable and convincing. 

Feature/Benefit examples: 

- Sometimes it's ok to change "10 Gigs of space" to "Space for 1M records". Or combine them ""10 Gigs of space for 1M records".
- "With a 64 GB hard drive, you can store all your important documents"
- "Merchandise with Query Rules"
- "Algolia offers filtering to better enable your users to fine-tune their results."

Provide an example before explaining a feature.
- "You might want to know if users are getting no results, or very few. Maybe you need to track user activity to better inform UI decisions. We provide click analytics just for these purposes."

### Marketing Vocabulary

Some of these ideas and words can be used but toned down. Here are some guidelines.

- **Speed** is a feature not a selling point
- **As you type** is a useful strategy not groundbreaking
- An Algolia index or solution is **Exhaustive**: We can actually handle any use case - describe them, otherwise and empty claim is ... empty, clutter, noise.
- Settings are **comprehensive**, arising naturally out of the subject, to solve the problem of search
- Settings are **precise** and **well-calibrated**, again, arising naturally out of the necessities of search
- Tie-breaking algorithm is "**effective**.
